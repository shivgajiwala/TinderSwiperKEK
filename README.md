# TinderSwiperKEK

Its self explainatory, and one of the friend asked for it. 
So here you go world.

## Description
This handy swiper tool utilizes pyautogui to swipe.
But sad thing is pyautogui cannot get window size, and I had to get around it by finding the center logo using the library and hard code the pixels the swippe travels.

## Things You Need For This To Work
* BlueStacks ([link](https://www.bluestacks.com/]))
* Python 2.7 ([link](https://www.python.org/download/releases/2.7/))
* pyautogui ([link](https://pyautogui.readthedocs.io/en/latest/))

## TODO LIST
- [ ] Dynamic swipe distance
- [ ] Stop/Start button
- [ ] Face/Ethnicity Detection
- [ ] increase swooping speed
